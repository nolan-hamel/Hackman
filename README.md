# Hackman
Welcome to HackMan by Nolan Hamel! This project is a submission for the Clemson CPSC Discord Hackman Challenge

IMPORTANT: This game requires .NET Runtime 6.0 to run, which can be found here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

This is a classic Hangman style game played in the console.

A player beings in the main menu and instructions are given under the title.
Because it's in the console it is completely keyboard-based input.

Source code can be found in the "Hackman" folder
